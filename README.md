# [Data Science with Python](https://github.com/SyedaAnoosha/Data-Science-with-Python)

This repository contains all my work during learning <b>Data Science</b>. It is based on Python.  

## Python Libraries

In <b>Data Science with Python</b> Repository, I have used following libraries:

1. [Numpy](/Numpy%20Python/)
2. [Pandas](/Pandas%20Python/)
3. [Matplotlib](/Data%20Visualization%20Python/Seaborn/)
4. [Seaborn](/Data%20Visualization%20Python/Seaborn/)

## Topics

This <b>Data Science with Python</b> Repository is based on following topics:

1. [Statistics](/Statistics/)
    
    I have learned about basic statistical concepts, such as probability, distributions, and hypothesis testing.

2. [Data Visualization with Seaborn](/Data%20Visualization%20Python/Seaborn/)

    I have learned how to use Python library Seaborn to create interactive and informative visualizations.

3. [Data Visualization with Matplotlib](/Data%20Visualization%20Python/Matplotlib/)

    I have learned how to use Python library Matplotlib to create interactive and informative visualizations.

4. [Data Manipulation](/Pandas%20Python/)

    I have learned how to use Python libraries like NumPy and Pandas to clean, transform, and analyze data.

5. [Exploratory Data Analysis](/Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis/)

    I have learned how to use EDA techniques to gain insights into data.

6. [Datasets Explored](/Exploring%20Datasets/)

    I have explored a variety of datasets, including the Titanic dataset.
